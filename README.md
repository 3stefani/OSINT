## 📖 About OSINT

**Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** refers to the collection and analysis of information gathered from publicly available sources. In cybersecurity, OSINT is crucial for:

- 🎯 Threat Intelligence & Actor Profiling
- 🔐 Security Assessments & Penetration Testing
- 🕵️ Digital Forensics & Incident Response
- 🌐 Cyber Threat Hunting
- 📊 Risk Assessment & Due Diligence

This portfolio demonstrates practical application of OSINT techniques in real-world scenarios through educational challenges and investigations.

## 🎯 My Approach

### Core Principles

```
Ethical → Systematic → Documented → Legal
```

- **Ethical Practice:** All investigations conducted within legal boundaries
- **Systematic Methodology:** Structured approach to information gathering
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed write-ups for reproducibility
- **Continuous Learning:** Staying updated with latest tools and techniques
